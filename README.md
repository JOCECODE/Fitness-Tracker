## Description

In this application, the user can either choose to continue their last workout or make a new workout. Each workout consists of exercises that can be named and stores depending on which workout the user is in. The application displays the users last workout and shows the total amount of time they spent working out. The user can update their workouts by adding in new exercises that will then get stored for them in the database. Workouts have a date and a unique idea for each to be able to reference the workouts easier. The application also features a visual display of the users data in the form of graphs such as a pie graph and a line graph.

## User-Story

```
 As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
